# ema-dist

TypeScript distribution scripts for EverMemoryArchive.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter ema-webui build
pnpm --filter ema-dist run revision
pnpm --filter ema-dist run download -- --platform linux-x64
pnpm --filter ema-dist run pack -- --platform linux-x64 --kind portable --format zip
pnpm --filter ema-dist run build -- --platform linux-x64
```

`download` writes portable runtime dependencies to:

```text
dist/$platform/EverMemoryArchive/portables
```

Application runtime files are staged under:

```text
dist/$platform/EverMemoryArchive/app/server.js
dist/$platform/EverMemoryArchive/app/.next/
dist/$platform/EverMemoryArchive/app/public/
dist/$platform/EverMemoryArchive/app/node_modules/  # native .node packages only
dist/$platform/EverMemoryArchive/server-relpath.txt
```

`app/server.js` is Vite's CommonJS bundle of Next.js' generated standalone
`packages/ema-webui/server.js`. Staging also bundles the generated
`.next/server/**/chunks/**/*.js` files in-place with Vite so the packaged app
does not depend on pnpm's standalone `node_modules` link tree for JavaScript.
Only Next runtime data files, static assets, `public`, EMA prompt/skill assets,
and target-platform native `.node` packages remain as copied files beside the
bundled JavaScript.

`build` writes CI-ready artifacts to `dist/$platform/`:

```text
ema-$platform-minimal-$revision.7z
ema-$platform-minimal-$revision-installer.{exe,run,command}
ema-$platform-portable-$revision.7z
ema-$platform-portable-$revision-installer.{exe,run,command}
ema-$platform-portable-debug-symbols-$revision.7z
ema-$platform-minimal-$revision.zip
ema-$platform-portable-$revision.zip
```

Each archive and installer is accompanied by a sibling `.sha256` file.

The platform ids are:

```text
win32-x64
win32-arm64
linux-x64
linux-arm64
linux-armhf
darwin-arm64
alpine-x64
```

Intel macOS (`darwin-x64`) bundles are not built because LanceDB 0.23.0 does
not publish `@lancedb/lancedb-darwin-x64`.

The revision is the nearest previous `v*` tag, or `v0.0.0` when no tag
exists. Untagged commits append the 12-character commit hash, and dirty
worktrees append `-dirty`.

## Portable vs minimal

`portable` bundles Node.js, MongoDB, and the 7-Zip command-line extractor under
`portables/` when upstream binaries exist for the platform.

Portable `.pdb` files are removed from portable archives and written to
`ema-$platform-portable-debug-symbols-$revision.7z` when present. The symbols
archive preserves the `EverMemoryArchive/...` relative paths so it can be
extracted over a matching portable package or added to a debugger symbol path.

Target-platform native runtime packages, such as LanceDB and Sharp binaries,
must be present before staging. Cross-platform builds fail during staging when
the matching optional native package is missing instead of producing an archive
that fails at runtime.
Distribution CI passes pnpm `--os`, `--cpu`, and `--libc` install options for
the target bundle platform so these optional packages are present.

`minimal` bundles only the built app and Rust launch/configure executable. It
can use Node.js and MongoDB from configured paths, from `PATH`, or via
`EMA_MONGO_URI`.

`packages/ema-dist/Cargo.toml` owns the Rust distribution helpers. Staging
builds `ema-launcher` and writes it into the package root as the only
start/configure/open-webui entrypoint:

```text
ema-launcher
ema-launcher configure
ema-launcher start  # equivalent to no arguments
ema-launcher open-webui <url> [webview|browser|none] [node]
```

Launchers open the WebUI in `EMA_OPEN_MODE=webview` by default. Rust keeps the
start/configuration flow, then calls the bundled `launcher/open-webui.mjs` with
the selected Node.js runtime. Staging still bundles that script with Vite so its
`default-browser` runtime dependency is included directly in
`launcher/open-webui.mjs`. The script opens an app-mode browser window without
the normal browser toolbar when Chrome, Edge, Chromium, or Brave is available
from Chrome-launcher-style paths, Windows App Paths, or `PATH`. If that fails,
it uses `default-browser` to identify the user's default browser before falling
back to the system URL handler. During installation the user is asked whether to
set `EMA_OPEN_MODE=browser` instead. `EMA_OPEN_MODE=none` starts only the server.
The staged package copies `.github/assets/ema-logo-min.jpg` into
`resources/ema-logo-min.jpg`; Windows setup and launcher builds generate and
embed an ignored `packages/ema-dist/assets/ema-logo.ico` version of that logo,
and Linux desktop entries reference the staged jpg.

Installer artifacts are Rust `setup` executables. `createSelfInstaller` compiles
`setup` with `EMA_DIST_SETUP_PAYLOAD_DIR` pointing at the staged package; the
build script packs that directory as an inline `tar.zst` payload and the setup
binary extracts it during installation. The portable setup therefore contains
the portable app tree directly instead of a base64 shell/cmd section plus a
bundled 7-Zip extractor.

Installer and `configure` answers are persisted in the normal user config
directory under `ema`: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/ema` on Linux,
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/ema` on macOS, and `%APPDATA%\ema` on
Windows. The file is `ema-runtime.env`, stored as plain `KEY=VALUE` lines and
parsed by the launchers without executing it as shell or batch script. Set
`EMA_CONFIG_HOME` to override this directory.

MongoDB Community Server does not publish `linux-armhf` or Alpine/musl archives.
For those platforms the CI produces minimal artifacts and a `.SKIPPED.txt` note
for portable artifacts unless `--include-unsupported-portable` is passed.
